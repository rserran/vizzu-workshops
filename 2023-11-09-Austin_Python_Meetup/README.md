## Hello there!
### Welcome to the repository folder for the Vizzu tutorial @ PyCon MEA
## We're thrilled to have you here with us! :blush:

In this readme and the repo, you'll find a collection of useful resources related to the talk and the workshop, such as the ipyvizzu notebooks used throughout the sessions, along with some additional ones that I've prepared for you to experiment and learn more about our tool.

Moreover, you'll find some helpful links to the Streamlit app and its source code, the ipyvizzu documentation, as well as to the bidirectional component that integrates ipyvizzu into Streamlit.
