## Hello there!
### Welcome to the repository folder for the Vizzu talk @ PyGotham: Let them explore! Building interactive, animated reports in Streamlit with ipyvizzu & a few lines of Python
## We're thrilled to have you here with us! :blush:

Here you'll find a collection of useful resources related to the talk, such as the ipyvizzu notebooks used throughout the session, along with some additional ones that I've prepared for you to experiment with and learn more about our tools.

Moreover, you'll find some helpful links to the Streamlit app and its source code, the ipyvizzu documentation, as well as to the bidirectional component that integrates ipyvizzu into Streamlit.
